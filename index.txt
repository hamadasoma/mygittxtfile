Branching
---------
git branch 
 " Creating branch "
git checkout -b NewFeature
 " Creating a feature branched of master. This feature is called NewFeature "
===============================================================
By default we are located in the master branch.

To create branch (NewFeature) from master ===>>  git checkout -b NewFeature
Now we are located in the NewFeature branch.
Any new commits will be associated to NewFeature branch 
Any [git log] command will show all commits under master and under NewFeature.
command [git bransh] will show which branch we are located in now. 
If we want to go to master branch ===> git checkout master
